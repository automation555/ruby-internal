DASGN:
  doc: |
    Represents dynamic local variable assignment.  Dynamic assignment
    differs from static assignment in that the slots for static local
    variables are allocated when the method is called, wereas slots for
    dynamic variables are allocated when the variable is first assigned
    to.  When searching for the variable, dynamic assignment searches
    backward up the stack to see if the variable exists in any previous
    block in the current frame; if it does, it assigns to the slot found
    in that block, otherwise it creates a new variable slot.  As a
    result, dynamic assignment is typically much slower than static
    assignment.

    In the first case, value is evaluated and head is evaluated, and
    they are compared using head === value.  If the result is true, then
    body is evaluated and no more when conditions are tried, otherwise
    the interpreter evaluates the next node.

    In the second case, head is tested using rtest(value).  If the
    result is true, then body is evaluated and no more when conditions
    are tried, otherwise the interpreter evaluates the next node.

    If the condition evaluates to false and there are no more when
    conditions to try, the result of the expression is nil.

    If the next expression to try is not a WHEN node, then it represents
    an else element and is evaluated unconditionally.
