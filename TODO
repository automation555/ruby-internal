* Clean up the code
  - Refactor module_load; code to create a subclass and code to attach
    an arbitrary class as a metaclass should be factored out
  - Split up unrelated code into separate source files
* Write more test cases
* Shouldn't be able to dump classes with non-default allocation
  functions; write a test for this
* Test for dumping a metaclass that has a metaclass
* Should real_superclass use rb_class_real() when including modules?
