* Clean up the code
  - Refactor module_load; code to create a subclass and code to attach
    an arbitrary class as a metaclass should be factored out
  - Split up unrelated code into separate source files
* Write more test cases
* Write code to dump/load class and class instance variables
* Code obfuscator should check ruby version before loading code
* Shouldn't be able to dump classes with non-default allocation
  functions; write a test for this
* Test for dumping a metaclass that has a metaclass
* Security checks
* Webpage with examples of how to use nodepp and classtree with irb (and
  put links to code on the net that use nodewrap).
* Remove GC.start from the test's setup method.
* Should real_superclass use rb_class_real() when including modules?
