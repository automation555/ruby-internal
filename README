This is nodewrap, a library that provides access to ruby's internal node
tree, among other things.

See the file LICENSE for license and copyright information.

To build and run the tests:
  ruby install.rb config
  ruby install.rb setup

Or, if you are on ruby 1.9, you'll need to pass a special command-line
option in the config step so the build scripts can find ruby's source
code:
  ruby install.rb config --ruby-source-path=/path/to/ruby
  ruby install.rb setup

To install:
  ruby install.rb install

See the generated documentation (in the doc/ directory) and the examples
(in the directory example/) for usage.

Some notes about security:

- Data can always be inspected.
- Methods that could potentially cause a crash if used incorrectly are
  disallowed with $SAFE >= 2.
- Methods that could allow access to potentially sensitive data are
  disallowed with $SAFE >= 4.
- Methods that load marshalled data do taint checks with $SAFE >= 1.
